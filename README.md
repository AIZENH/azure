Its a Kustro Query Language script to help you parse the data you are given in log analytics workspace 
or other features since the earlier feature to parse the data was removed from the user interface. 
This script was tailor made for my data at hand and its a just a fromat of how the command should be.
I struggled a bit reaching here and hope other people wont have to that much. You can make your own changes 
with repect your own data.
